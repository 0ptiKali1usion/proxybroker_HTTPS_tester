# proxybroker_HTTPS_tester
 Use proxybroker to get 20 HTTPS proxies, test them with curl, and get a list of the fastest ones, that actually work.

People tell me you gotta pay for decent proxies these days.

If you want this, open a shell, make sure you have proxybroker:

$ python3.5 -m pip install proxybroker

proxybroker runs/works best in python3.5 I find.

Then run:

$ git clone https://github.com/0ptiKali1usion/proxybroker_HTTPS_tester.git
$ cd proxybroker_HTTPS_tester
$ chmod +x *
$ ./masterscript.sh

I am a rank amatuer, and have been for thrity years, so, maybe I'll make better documentation?

BYE!
